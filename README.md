🪐 3D Portfolio Website using Three.js
🚀 Overview

This is an interactive 3D portfolio website built using Three.js and Vite.
It showcases my projects, skills, and creativity through visually appealing 3D elements, animations, and responsive design.

The goal of this project is to go beyond traditional portfolios by combining WebGL graphics, JavaScript, and modern web design into an immersive personal website experience.

🧠 Features

🌌 Dynamic 3D Scene using Three.js (stars, space background, and lighting)

🪄 Animated camera and objects for smooth motion and interaction

🧑‍💻 Portfolio sections (About, Projects, Contact) integrated with 3D visuals

⚡ Built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds

📱 Responsive and deployable on Vercel or any static hosting platform
